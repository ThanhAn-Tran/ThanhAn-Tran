## About Me  
I'm a final-year IT student at Ho Chi Minh City University of Foreign Languages – Information Technology, passionate about leveraging AI and automation to drive data-informed decisions. With hands-on experience in building intelligent systems—particularly using LLMs and machine learning—for product analytics and operations, I’m constantly exploring how technology can solve real-world problems.

## What I’m Looking For  
Currently seeking an internship opportunity to apply skills in AI, data analysis, and automation. I'm eager to contribute to intelligent system development, enhance operational workflows, and collaborate on impactful, data-driven projects—while continuously honing my communication and problem-solving abilities.

## Skills  
- **Languages:** Python, SQL  
- **Frameworks & Tools:** Transformers (Hugging Face), OpenAI SDK, LangChain, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Docker

## Featured Projects  
- **Air Quality Index Monitor** — An intelligent AQI monitoring tool that combines machine learning predictions and LLM-based natural language interaction. The system predicts AQI using a trained MLP model, stores large-scale sensor data in Cassandra, and allows users to ask questions through Claude API.
